# rxjs-advent-of-code

Going to see how far into Advent of Code I can get this year, while keeping everything in a single RxJS observable from text file input until printing the solution.

I also want to limit how much I do imperatively in map/reduce and try to lean more on RxJS operators, but not sure how far I'll get with that.
